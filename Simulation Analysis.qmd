## Set Up

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| results: hide
library(ggplot2)
library(moments)
set.seed(2626)
# TODO: change back to 100k
r <- 10000 # number of repetitions
# sample_sizes <- c(5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 100, 200, 300, 400, 2000, 3000, 4000)
sample_sizes <- c(5, 10, 20)
```

We are opting to create 100,000 samples (repetitions) to create the sampling distribution so as to mitigate any concerns of random variability influencing our conclusions.

```{r}
analysis <- function(f, distro, n, ...) {
  hist(distro(n))
  sample_means <- replicate(r, f(distro(n, ...)))
  hist(sample_means)
  qqnorm(sample_means)
  qqline(sample_means)

  skewness(sample_means)
}

lapply(sample_sizes, analysis, distro = rlnorm, f = mean, mu = 0, sigma = 1)
lapply(sample_sizes, analysis, distro = rlnorm, f = mean, mu = 0, sigma = 0.5)
```

Distributions:

-   Just use Pearson?

-   Use log normal and adjust sigma for skewness level?

-   Exponential

-   Normal

-   Chi Square

-   Uniform
